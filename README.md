# Project Title

2022_HTML-CSS_CA_HMA_rainy-days

## Description

A webshop for his and hers jackets made for educational purposes.

## Changes made from the figma design:

- Removed quick buy button from product list.

- Product counter is non functional because I could not figure out if it was even doable with HTML and CSS only.

- Card hover removed because it bugged out the flexbox.

- Checkout cta's moved to have the name:required function
